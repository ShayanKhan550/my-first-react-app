Here’s the basic Git branch + Pull Request (PR) workflow step-by-step 👇

Clone the repo (first time only)

git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-name>


Create a new branch for your task

git checkout -b feature/your-task-name


Do your code changes
Edit, add, or delete files as needed.

Stage and commit your changes

git add .
git commit -m "Add feature: your message here"


Push your branch to GitHub

git push origin feature/your-task-name


Create a Pull Request (PR)

Go to GitHub → your repo → “Compare & pull request”

Add a clear title + description

Choose the base branch (usually main or develop)

Submit the PR for review

Review & Merge

Team reviews your code

If approved → PR is merged into main branch

Clean up

git branch -d feature/your-task-name      # delete local branch
git push origin --delete feature/your-task-name   # delete remote branch
